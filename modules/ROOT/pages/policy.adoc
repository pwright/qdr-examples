= Single standalone router using vHost Policies
:source-filename: /home/paulwright/repos/a/qdr-examples/policy/README.md

This scenario contains a single router deployment that uses a config map that contains vHost policies.
The policies are loaded at the moment pod is created, so changes to the policy config map needs a redeploy.
